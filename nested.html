       <p>At <b>Boise State</b> I have made a lot of friends. I joined the <u>Korean Club</u> and found people who share the same <i>intrests </i>as me.</p>
       <p>I enjoy learning different <b>languages and cultures</b>. <u>Korean</u> has been the easiest language for me to <em>learn</em>.</p>
       <p>My favorite things to do are...
           <ul>
               <li>Spend time with friends and family</li>
               <li>Create art like <i>drawing and painting</i></li>
               <li>Watch a movie or tv show</li>
           </ul>
       </p>

           Fall is my favorite time of year!<br> 
           Esspecially when the wheather gets <span style="color:blue">colder</span> and the leaves begin to change colors.<br>
           I like fall because there are <b>so many fun things</b> that happen around this time of year!
